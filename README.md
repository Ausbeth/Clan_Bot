# Clan_Bot
A Discord bot developed in Python for my clan in naruto-arena.net.

Naruto-Arena.net is a turn-based, tactical online multiplayer browser game played based on the Shounen Anime and Manga series called Naruto. You pick 3 characters to form a team and battle it out against other players. Players battle for different purposes: Ranking up to number 1, unlocking more characters, or having fun against friends by playing private battles. You can make friends by sending requests to players or through the naruto-arena discord server.

A clan is the name given to a community of players who come together for various purposes. Wars are another aspect of the game where clans face other clans based on certain rules and conditions.

This bot was developed for the purpose of helping I and my clanmates with Wars by making it easier for us to build teams that meet the criteria of the war's rules. This bot displays a graphical representation of all available characters in a certain war.
